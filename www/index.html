Employee #1 was unloading wheat from the second  &#34;bottom dump&#34; trailer of his truck, which was manually opened at the side of  the trailer. Employee #1 heard his 13-year-old son yelling and immediately  closed the bottom opening of the trailer. He ran to top of the trailer, where  he saw his son engulfed by the funnel-shaped grains, with only his hand  visible. Rescue efforts proved futile, and the boy was pronounced dead, after  he was finally freed from the grains through the bottom of the trailer. The  Petaluma Fire Department reported the incident to the Division.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">At approximately 9:56 a.m. on July 28, 2010, three employees were emptying a  500,000-bushel steel plate corn storage bin at a grain elevator. Employee #1  became caught in the corn flowing into the second of two bin bottom dump  points emptying into a conveyor below the bin. Three other workers nearby,  Employee #2, Employee #3, and a coworker, attempted to free Employee #1. When  the workers trying to rescue Employee #1 recognized that their attempt was  futile, Employee #3 ordered the coworker, who was nearest the exit ladder, to  exit and notify the control room to stop the conveyors and to call emergency  medical services and the elevator manager. The coworker did so, while  Employees #2 and #3 continued trying to rescue Employee #1. Employee #1 was  totally engulfed, and Employee #2 was engulfed up to his neck. Employee #3 was  engulfed up to his shoulders. He could still move his arms, so he kept trying  to rescue Employee #2. He did this by manually moving flowing corn away from  Employee #2&#39;s face in an attempt to maintain an airway. Once the conveyor was  stopped, corn continued to flow to a settling trickle. By this time, Employee  #2 was totally engulfed. Employee #3 continued moving corn to maintain his own  airway until emergency medical services arrived and secured him by tying him  off. Employee #3 survived his engulfment. He was rescued and airlifted to a  trauma unit at approximately 4:15 p.m. Two of the three engulfed employees  were suffocated and died onsite. The bodies of Employee #1 and Employee #2  were recovered at 10:15 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. the same day. The workers were not  trained in the hazards associated with grain bin entry, in the required use of  PPE, or in the general safety requirements of the facility. Dust masks were  the only PPE in use. Language was not an issue. A fifth bin worker was not  involved. The elevator manager was working alone in an adjacent bin with a  sweep auger.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">Employee #1, age 15, was atop a railroad car watching the unloading of corn  from the center bin compartment. He was last seen sitting on the edge of the  compartment with his legs hanging freely in the bin. Employee #1 apparently  lost his balance, fell into the compartment, and was pulled under the flowing  corn in the bin. He died of suffocation. There were no witnesses to the fall.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">Employee #1, age 17, climbed on top of a rail car of corn after he had opened  its bottom hopper to unload the grain.

                <div class="tab-content">Employee #1 and two coworkers entered a grain storage tank from the ground  level, climbing the sloping grain to a height of about 20 ft to clear the tank  walls. The tank measured 117 by 72 ft and was approximately 1/3 full of  millet. The two coworkers brushed the walls and threw the sour grain chuck  down to Employee #1, who was located below. The operator, who was positioned  at the control panel outside the tank, started the underground auger conveyor  and opened one of the gates on the floor of the tank to permit the grain to  flow into the conveyor. Employee #1 got too close to the gate and effectively  had the floor cut out from under him. The resulting slide of grain from above  buried him, and he died of asphyxiation. Causal factors include: lack of  employee training in bin entry procedures, lack of effective lockout/tagout  procedures, and lack of a lifeline or restraining device to prevent an  employee from sinking into the grain.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">On June 14, 2001, Employee #1 and two other employees were unloading a railcar  of wheat. The plant manager was operating a small belt conveyor to unload the  car on one side. The other employee was watching the grain process from the  opposite side of the car. The manager heard something and stopped the  operation. He went to the other side of the railcar to locate Employee #1, the  young summer helper. The two employees went to the top of the car where they  found the safety glasses of Employee #1 lying on the railcar catwalk. They  could not see him or get a response from calling so they opened the car dump  and pushed it along the track to get the grain out faster. They then saw the  legs of Employee #1. He had fallen into the grain hopper and was buried in  grain. The manager summoned emergency medical services. The paramedics arrived  and transported him to the hospital, but he died the next day.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">Employee #1, a laborer, was shoveling corn into a silo chute inside a corn bin  that measured 42 ft diameter and 34 ft 5 in. high. The gravity-fed auger at  the bottom of the bin was running, but jammed. Employee #1 was using a piece  of PVC to dislodge the area over the auger. He was standing over the auger on  the corn and pushing down. The auger opening was 12 in. square with an 8 in.  tube auger 12 in. below floor level. The corn was about 7 ft deep in the  center over the auger. Employee #1 began to sink into the corn. Rescue  attempts were unsuccessful and Employee #1 suffocated and died. There appear  to be training inadequacies, lockout was not used before clearing the jam, and  the auger was not guarded. The running auger was vibrating the bin.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">On May 7, 2007, Employee #1 and Employee #2 were cleaning a grain bin. The  employees entered the grain bin to shovel millet to the center of the bin.  Employee #1 and Employee #2 were aware that the auger was running, while the  employees were inside of the grain bin. The flow of grain had slowed. Employee  #2 exited the bin to go below to the auger and clear what he believed to be a  clog. The supervisor was involved in a second task, when Employee #2 exited  the bin. The running auger created a condition where the grain was flowing,  and Employee #1 became caught in the flow and was pulled under the millet.  Employee #2 returned to the bin. The supervisor asked where Employee #1 was  located. After a search of the area, they determined that the millet had  engulfed Employee #1. The employee was located under the millet by Emergency  Services and the Sheriffs Department&#39;s personnel approximately 30 minutes  after the accident occurred. The official cause of death was ruled as  asphyxiation. There was no restraint or retrieval equipment available at the  site to keep the employee from being fully engulfed or to assist with pulling  Employee #1 from the grain bin.</div>

The kernels had  accumulated in the silo to the height of approximately 33 to 35 feet. The  employees were to walk on the kernels to push them down. This process is known  as &#34;walking down the corn.&#34; The auger in the silo continued to operate while  the employees walked down the corn. The wall of kernels caved in, burying  Employee #1. The coworkers attempted to rescue him, but were not successful.  There was no retrieval system in place for this kind of rescue effort and the  employees were not trained in the specific procedures and safety practices of  this task.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">At 10:30 a.m. on February 21, 2002, Employee #1 and Employee #2 of Silver Lake  Welding Service, Incorporated were working inside feed bin number 17 repairing  worn metal plating on the walls. The air actuated slide gate for bin number 17  was opened, releasing its contents of approximately 12 feet in depth grain  with two employees caught in the grain. The older employee was pulled under  the grain first with his legs partially exposed out the slide gate opening.  The other employee also pulled under the grain was wedged in on top of the  older employee, preventing the two from coming on through the slide gate  opening. A truck driver called for medical assistance. The Elkin Rescue  Service arrived at the accident site and found one of the employees for Silver  Lake Welding Service, Incorporated using a cutting torch to make a  36-inch-square large hole opening to help free the two trapped employees. The  older employee was partially removed up to his chest by the time the second  Elkin Rescue Service member arrived on site. The Elkin Rescue Service, at the  top of the feed mill bins, observed that the hand operated, Model 482, hoist,  with PN A7332, was set in place above the entrance into feed bin Number 17. A  boatswain chair and swing seat was attached by a 0.375-inch diameter metal  cable to the hoist. The boatswain chair and swing seat had been lowered into  feed bin Number 17. The 0.375-inch diameter metal cable for personnel live  line rescue was attached around one of the metal angle iron post used to  support the feed inlet pipes used to transfer feed grain. There were three  electric cords running into feed bin Number 17. One cord was for a stick  welder, one for an explosion-proof light, and one for a portable grinder. A  vent hose was lying next to the entrance of feed bin Number 17, but not inside  the bin. There were two ladders in use at the time of the accident. The metal  fixed-rung ladder was hung over the entrance into the feed bin Number 17, and  the fiberglass extension ladder was inside feed bin Number 17 at the time of  the accident. The Elkin Rescue Service members removed the two employees from  the bottom of feed bin Number 17 at the pneumatic actuated slide gate opening  cut open by one of Silver Lake Welding Service employees. The  pneumatic-actuated slide gate door opening after being cut was pulled back out  of the way by the Elkin Rescue Service with a portable hand hoist. Due to the  two employees being wedge in on top of one another it took the Emergency  Services approximately 3 hours to free them. Employee #1 and Employee #2 were  treated by the Emergency Medical Services and died from asphyxia before being  transported to Northern Surry Hospital in Mount Airy.</div>

The facility specialized in the distribution of  wheat through trucks. As Employee #2 checked with Employee #1, to see if he  needed a break, three bins located on the south side of the facility  ruptured/opened up and wheat spilled out onto the truck dump area. Employees  #1 and #2 were engulfed by the wheat, as well as the structure&#39;s debris, and  died due to asphyxiation. Approximately three hours later the bodies of  Employees #1 and #2 were recovered from underneath a semi-truck, which had  been at the dumping site.</div>

Employees #1 and three coworkers entered the bin to push  soybeans and other material toward the discharge chute. Employee #1 stood next  to the discharge chute. Two coworkers stood by the soybeans in the bin while  the last employee was moving around the outer edge of the bin dislodging small  areas of soybeans. The three coworkers were using shovels and potato forks to  dislodge and push the soybeans and other material toward the discharge chute  by Employee #1. Two employees uncovered an area that connected the bin being  cleaned to an adjoining interstice bin. Soybeans from the interstice bin began  to flow very rapidly. Due to the angled floor of the bin, the flowing soybeans  naturally moved to the discharge chute. Employee #1 was swept off his feet and  into the discharge chute. The discharge chute led to the drag conveyor that  fed the grain dryer. Employee #1 was engulfed by the soybeans. One employee  closed the slide gate, trapping Employee #1&#39;s foot in the gate. The five  remaining contract employees and the host employer&#39;s rescue personnel were  unable to remove Employee #1. The discharge slide gate was reopened, causing  Employee #1 to move further down the chute. Employee #1 suffocated before the  discharge chute could be removed by the host employer. Employee #1 was wearing  a fall arrest harness but did not attach the harness and lanyard to the  lifeline. Employee #1 died. Employee #2 broke his collar bone due to the  strain of pulling on the shoulder strap of Employee #1&#39;s harness. The  surviving employees were taken to the hospital for observation. Only Employee  #2 was hospitalized for one night.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">At approximately 8:00 a.m. On February 20, 2007, Employees #1 and #2 were  standing on an outdoor corn storage pile using shovel and pipe to remove or  break up clots to keep grain flowing through a ground level grate over the  drag conveyor. Employees #1 and #2 were in radio contact with the employee  manning the control panel for the conveyors. A radio distress call from  Employee #1 to the control room operator indicated that the men were in the  grain. The control room operator shut down the conveyor systems and ran to the  corn pile, but no radio contact could be established with Employees #1 or #2.  The control room operator changed frequencies and called for help on his radio  and began climbing the corn pile. Employees #1 and #2 were not visible and  assumed to be under the corn. One of the office staff heard the distress call  and summoned emergency medical services. All employees who heard the call for  help from the control room operator immediately responded to the corn pile.  The area manager and a couple other employees climbed the pile and entered the  inverted cone where grain had been removed. The men tried to rescue Employees  #1 and #2, but the corn repeatedly rolled back into the cone. One of the  laborers drove a truck over to the adjacent construction project where a dirt  contractor was working to solicit help. The dirt contractor responded to the  pile with all equipment and personnel to aid in rescue/recovery. The outdoor  ground pile was 270 ft across and capable of storing 1,000,000 bushels of  corn. The pile was round at the base and conical. The central tower and outer  4-ft bunker walls were controlled aeration and the moving air up the tower  pulled the tarp closer to the corn and preventing wind from removing the tarp.  The drag conveyor was operating while the employees were on top of the pile.  No lifelines or other effective means to prevent them from sinking greater  than waist deep in the corn were provided. On February 20, 2007, all employees  attended confined space training from approximately 7:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. The  confined space video shown to employees did not discuss or mention engulfment  hazards. Employees were aware of engulfment hazards, but state that the  one-half hour training session did not cover engulfment. This was Employee  #2&#39;s second day of work. The one-half hour training session is the only  training that Employee #2 received. The training is provided annually, but was  specifically held February 20, 2007, because of Employee #2 (the new  employee). It is believed that the half-empty pile still held approximately  500,000 bushels of corn. Management and responders estimated that the pile was  about 20 ft where Employees #1 and #2 were working. Responders could not move  the corn back by hand without it rolling back. The heavy equipment operators  pulled grain away from the area the employees were believed to be. Two fire  department personnel helped in recovery efforts wearing full body harness  attached to the elevator leg/conveyor that lead to the pile. Both Employees #1  and #2 bodies were recovered more than 4 hours later, beneath 10 ft to 20 ft  of corn.</div>

Employee #1 was found dead of  asphyxia, lodged in the chute at the bottom of the bin and covered in corn.

                <div class="tab-content">At approximately 8:00 a.m. On February 20, 2007, Employees #1 and #2 were  standing on an outdoor corn storage pile using shovel and pipe to remove or  break up clots to keep grain flowing through a ground level grate over the  drag conveyor. Employees #1 and #2 were in radio contact with the employee  manning the control panel for the conveyors. A radio distress call from  Employee #1 to the control room operator indicated that the men were in the  grain. The control room operator shut down the conveyor systems and ran to the  corn pile, but no radio contact could be established with Employees #1 or #2.  The control room operator changed frequencies and called for help on his radio  and began climbing the corn pile. Employees #1 and #2 were not visible and  assumed to be under the corn. One of the office staff heard the distress call  and summoned emergency medical services. All employees who heard the call for  help from the control room operator immediately responded to the corn pile.  The area manager and a couple other employees climbed the pile and entered the  inverted cone where grain had been removed. The men tried to rescue Employees  #1 and #2, but the corn repeatedly rolled back into the cone. One of the  laborers drove a truck over to the adjacent construction project where a dirt  contractor was working to solicit help. The dirt contractor responded to the  pile with all equipment and personnel to aid in rescue/recovery. The outdoor  ground pile was 270 ft across and capable of storing 1,000,000 bushels of  corn. The pile was round at the base and conical. The central tower and outer  4-ft bunker walls were controlled aeration and the moving air up the tower  pulled the tarp closer to the corn and preventing wind from removing the tarp.  The drag conveyor was operating while the employees were on top of the pile.  No lifelines or other effective means to prevent them from sinking greater  than waist deep in the corn were provided. On February 20, 2007, all employees  attended confined space training from approximately 7:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. The  confined space video shown to employees did not discuss or mention engulfment  hazards. Employees were aware of engulfment hazards, but state that the  one-half hour training session did not cover engulfment. This was Employee  #2&#39;s second day of work. The one-half hour training session is the only  training that Employee #2 received. The training is provided annually, but was  specifically held February 20, 2007, because of Employee #2 (the new  employee). It is believed that the half-empty pile still held approximately  500,000 bushels of corn. Management and responders estimated that the pile was  about 20 ft where Employees #1 and #2 were working. Responders could not move  the corn back by hand without it rolling back. The heavy equipment operators  pulled grain away from the area the employees were believed to be. Two fire  department personnel helped in recovery efforts wearing full body harness  attached to the elevator leg/conveyor that lead to the pile. Both Employees #1  and #2 bodies were recovered more than 4 hours later, beneath 10 ft to 20 ft  of corn.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">A 500,000-bushel grain elevator that was staffed by a single employee had  problems with milo flowing in one of its bins. The lone employee, a branch  manager, called for a second person to help him free the grain. An elevator  operator who had frequently worked at that elevator arrived to help. The  manager measured the grain to be 34 meters (111 feet) from the top of the bin.  From this measurement, he estimated the depth of the grain to be 1 meter (3  feet). The manager decided to use sewer tape to try to free the grain. The  operator donned a safety belt and rope, which was tied to a pulley system  located on the bin just outside the manhole entry. However, the rope was not  drawn tight, and there was too much slack in it. While the operator was in the  bin, the manager went to the boot to run the sewer tape up through the chute  and hopper. When the manager returned to the floor level, he discovered that  the operator had been covered by the grain. The manager then tried to pull the  injured employee out but failed. The manager then called for emergency medical  services and returned to the bin. He tried to rescue the injured employee with  a shovel but was again unsuccessful. Emergency medical services arrived and, 4  hours later, freed the injured employee from the bin. According to rescue  personnel, there was about 3 meters (10 feet) of grain at the unsloped portion  of the bin where the injured employee was found. The grain was apparently  deeper there than it was near the edge of the bin. The employee, who had been  buried under about 2.1 meters (7 feet) of grain, was pronounced dead at the  scene. He had suffocated. The employees failed to follow entry permit  procedures for the entry, and the employer&#39;s training of the employees in  confined space entry procedures was inadequate.</div>

The employees were  having trouble with the gluten falling down out of the coned bin. Employee #1  walked away and entered the coned bin to break up the gluten. The coworker  started loading the feed onto the wagon. While loading the feed, the coworker  noticed the gluten start to slow down. He went over to the coned bin to  unclump the gluten. He stuck his hand in the bottom of the coned bin, and felt  what he thought was rubber, but then realized it was a shoe. He began to look  for Employee #1, but no one had seen him. Employee #1 was in the coned bin and  had been engulfed in the gluten material. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at  the scene. Preliminary cause of death was compressional asphyxia with airway  obstruction.</div>

One of  the employees tied a rope around his waist before entering the bin, which had  sloping sides. The three employees began to loosen the corn from the sides of  the bins with shovels. A rat ran past one employee, and another employee tried  to kill the rat. Employee #1 moved out of the way and as he stepped away, the  corn started to slide. The corn carried Employee #1 down to the chute at the  bottom of the bin. His legs went in and got stuck, as the corn continued to  slowly cover him up. One employee left to get help. The other employee stayed  but left after Employee #1 was fully covered with corn and was killed by  suffocation.</div>

Employee  #1 was found inside of a flaked corn storage bin with a shovel and was  apparently shoveling the material to make room for an estimated half-ton of  the flaked corn that remained in the cooler. A coworker noticed that the  flaked corn system blower was still operating at 6:30 p.m. and knew that  Employee #1 had been operating the system earlier and should have been done by  this time. The coworker shut off the blower and called for Employee #1, but  got no reply. The coworker began looking for the employee and noticed that the  cover to the Flaked Corn Bin #13 was open. The coworker climbed the ladder to  the top and saw Employee #1&#39;s hands protruding from the corn, he also saw a  shovel on top of the corn. It appears Employee #1 entered Bin #13 without  complying with confined space requirements to shovel material away from the  fill chute in order to get the remaining material from the cooler into the  bin. The bin had a void inside which was created when material was removed by  the bottom auger and the material above became bridged. When Employee #1  entered the bin from the top, the bridged area inside of the bin gave way  under the combined weight of the added material from the fill chute and  Employee #1. Employee #1 was engulfed by the corn and asphyxiated. Employee #1  died of asphyxia.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">On May 12, 2009, Employee #1 was a assisting a driver in loading a dump truck  with old wheat from a bin, when the auger within the bin became clogged with  clumps of wet wheat. According to the driver, Employee #1 attempted to  dislodge the clumps of wheat from outside of the bin, using an approximately  10-foot long piece of metal rebar. When the auger was clogged with clumps of  wheat, it would trip the 10-Amp circuit breaker, and the driver went to the  shed to turn the breaker back on. When the driver returned to the bin, he  found Employee #1 inside the bin, engulfed in wheat. The driver attempted but  failed to free and pull Employee #1 out. He then called the owner, who was  just pulling up on the site. Both the driver and the owner attempted but  failed to free Employee #1 and then called emergency responders. EMS and the  Fire Department arrived at approximately 11:05 a.m. and IOW (apparently Isle  of Wight) Police arrived at 11:17 a.m. Employee #1 was found standing in an  upright position, with his right foot lodged beneath the auger. The report  from the office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Norfolk, VA indicated  asphyxiation as the cause of death. The Compliance Safety and Health Officer  (CSHO) spoke with the IOW County Fire Department Captain and learned that that  they removed four truckloads (approximately 500 bushels per truckload) of  wheat in order to remove Employee #1 from the bin. From interviews with the  owner, Fire Department, and EMS, the CSHO learned that the grain was  approximately 4 and 1/2 feet high by the door of the bin and approximately 15  feet high at the opposite wall. It was common practice for the employer and  the employees to enter the bin to dislodge the auger, which tripped the 10-Amp  circuit breaker when it was clogged with clumps of wheat. The CSHO observed  manufacturer&#39;s warnings signs indicating, &#34;CONFINED SPACE - DO NOT ENTER&#34;, on  the door of the bin and warning signs on the auger to perform LOTO  (lockout/tagout) when servicing the bin or performing maintenance. When  interviewed, the owner revealed that entering the bin to dislodge wheat from  the auger was common practice, and he had instructed Employee #1 to enter the  bin, and use the 10-foot-long rebar to dislodge the wheat. The owner told the  CSHO that his insurance provider said his employees should never enter the  grain elevator (bin) while wheat is being stored.</div>

A  boatswain chair and swing seat was attached by a 0.375-inch diameter metal  cable to the hoist. The boatswain chair and swing seat had been lowered into  feed bin Number 17. The 0.375-inch diameter metal cable for personnel live  line rescue was attached around one of the metal angle iron post used to  support the feed inlet pipes used to transfer feed grain. There were three  electric cords running into feed bin Number 17. One cord was for a stick  welder, one for an explosion-proof light, and one for a portable grinder. A  vent hose was lying next to the entrance of feed bin Number 17, but not inside  the bin. There were two ladders in use at the time of the accident. The metal  fixed-rung ladder was hung over the entrance into the feed bin Number 17, and  the fiberglass extension ladder was inside feed bin Number 17 at the time of  the accident. The Elkin Rescue Service members removed the two employees from  the bottom of feed bin Number 17 at the pneumatic actuated slide gate opening  cut open by one of Silver Lake Welding Service employees. The  pneumatic-actuated slide gate door opening after being cut was pulled back out  of the way by the Elkin Rescue Service with a portable hand hoist. Due to the  two employees being wedge in on top of one another it took the Emergency  Services approximately 3 hours to free them. Employee #1 and Employee #2 were  treated by the Emergency Medical Services and died from asphyxia before being  transported to Northern Surry Hospital in Mount Airy.</div>

                <div class="tab-content">A grain elevator superintendent and a truck driver, both employees of a grain  elevator company, were loading a truck with soybeans from a 7,600-kiloliter  capacity steel bin that was 18 meters high and 23 meters in diameter. The  superintendent ascended the outside ladder and descended the inside ladder of  the bin. He then stood on the beans, trying to unclog the open front floor  hole with a garden hoe. The truck driver, who was in radio contact with the  superintendent, stayed outside the bin. The truck driver told the worker in  the bin that they needed to stop the loading operation and take care of  another customer at another building for 10 to 15 minutes. The driver shut off  the unload conveyor. When he returned to the bin, he told the superintendent  that they needed to run the unload conveyor for about 3 more minutes to fill  the truck, which had a capacity of approximately 29 kiloliters. When the truck  was filled, the driver turned off the unload conveyor and told the  superintendent to exit the bin. The superintendent said it would be easier to  exit the bottom side door of the bin, but the driver advised the  superintendent that there was too much product in front of the door to exit  there. Because he did not want to climb the ladders, and despite a second  warning, the superintendent insisted on leaving by the side door. As the truck  driver started to leave to deliver his load, he heard the superintendent call  for help on the radio. The driver summoned emergency medical services and  found the superintendent totally engulfed by soybeans. The coroner pronounced  the superintendent dead of asphyxia at the scene. There was an estimated 1,200  kiloliters of soybeans in the bin at the time of the accident. The employer&#39;s  written safety and health program prohibited entry into bins from above the  level of the grain without a body harness, with life line or boatswain&#39;s  chair, an attendant, and suitable rescue equipment. It was company policy  never to enter a grain bin from the top. The superintendent had 30 years of  experience in the grain handling industry.</div>

When Employee #1 broke up the clog the grain started to flow and  Employee #1 was engulfed in approximately 20 ft of grain. He died.</div>

Wood &amp; Son, Inc., of Camden, NC, and a coworker  entered a door near the bottom of grain bin #5 to push the remaining shelled  corn down to the bottom of the bin to the auger. They were not wearing safety  harnesses or safety belts with lanyards, rescue equipment was not positioned  at the entrance of the bin, and an observer was not positioned outside the  entrance. Employee #1 was working near the bottom of the bin when shelled corn  fell down and covered him. Coworkers were unable to pull him out. At  approximately 11:30 a.m., the Camden County Volunteer Fire Department removed  him from the bin. Employee #1 was transported to the Albemarle Hospital in  Elizabeth City, where he was pronounced dead.</div>

Employee  #1 entered bin #9 near the top and was holding the end of a 60 ft long, 1/2  in. nylon rope, which was also secured to the exterior access ladder. At the  same time, soybeans were being removed from bin #9 by a sweep auger in the  floor of the bin and a 16 in. diameter auger located beneath the bin. The  grain was being redistributed and blended into other bins and trucks. At  approximately 11:45 a.m., a coworker went to check on Employee #1 and was  unable to locate him. Employee #1 was declared missing and rescue attempts  were begun. The body of Employee #1 was recovered at approximately 9:40 p.m.  on December 13, 1990, after the bin had been sufficiently emptied to allow  rescuers to enter and recover the body.</div>
